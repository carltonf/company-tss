Company backend for [[https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-tss][aki2o/emacs-tss]] with colorful doc ;)

*WIP*: incomplete and unstable yet.

* *NOTE* The package can only work with my forked version of emacs-tss

Patches are sent through pull requests already. The original author is busy now,
so wait.

At the meantime, use the forked version and enjoy ;)

* TODO lists [0/1]
 
** TODO A function to clean dangled tss processes
dangled tss processes do happen (though not exactly knowing how)

like what `tramp' does.
